# 🏥 AI-Based Hospital Queue Management System

A **Full Stack + AI** based solution to manage hospital queues efficiently, reduce patient waiting time, and improve overall healthcare service quality.

> 🚧 **Project Status: In Progress**  
> This project is currently under active development. The core functionality is implemented, and advanced AI features are being added.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Hospitals often face long waiting times, overcrowded queues, and inefficient patient flow management. Traditional token systems do not provide real-time updates or accurate waiting time predictions, leading to patient dissatisfaction and operational challenges.

---

## 💡 Project Overview
This project aims to build an **intelligent hospital queue management system** using **Node.js, React.js, and AI**.  
The system digitizes patient queues, provides real-time visibility, and predicts patient waiting time using AI-based logic.

The objective is to demonstrate how modern web technologies and artificial intelligence can solve real-world healthcare problems.
