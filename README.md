# -AI-Based-Hospital-Queue-Management-System

This project is a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** developed to demonstrate how **Full Stack + AI** can be used to improve hospital queue management, reduce patient waiting time, and enhance operational efficiency.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Hospitals often struggle with long waiting queues, lack of real-time queue visibility, and inefficient patient flow. Existing systems do not provide accurate waiting time predictions, causing frustration for patients and staff.

---

## 💡 MVP Solution
The MVP provides a **basic yet functional digital queue management system** with an **AI-based waiting time prediction** feature.

The goal of this MVP is to validate the idea and demonstrate real-world applicability within limited development time.

---

## 🚀 MVP Features
- Patient registration and token generation  
- Department-wise queue management  
- Real-time queue status display  
- AI-based estimated waiting time prediction  
- Simple admin view for queue monitoring  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js  
- HTML5, CSS3  
- JavaScript  

### Backend
- Node.js  
- Express.js  

### Database
- MongoDB  

### AI / Logic
- Waiting time prediction using historical averages  
- Basic machine learning logic for estimation  

---

## 🤖 AI in MVP (Simplified)
In this MVP, the AI module:
- Calculates average consultation time
- Analyzes number of patients in the queue
- Predicts approximate waiting time
- Improves accuracy as more data is collected

> ⚠️ Note: This is a simplified AI model intended for MVP demonstration.
